FRC 2018 Driver Station
======

Depends on [this library](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary). Currently has a button that blinks with a period of 1 second, which I think is pretty cool.

## Defined Mappings

| Input     | Joystick Output |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Pot on A0 | X Axis          |

## To Do

- Write the _actual_ inputs, instead of the test ones we have right now.
